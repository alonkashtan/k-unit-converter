A unit conversion unit with an explicit API (unlike the string-based API found in most js libraries) that compiles both to javascript (as an NPM package) and Java (as a JAR), and therefore can be used in JS frontend, nodejs backend and Java backends.

This is also a simple example of how to build a multi-platform Kotlin library to Java and NPM.
